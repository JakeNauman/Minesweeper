# Minesweeper
Interactive Minesweeper game written in Java

7/12/22 Project to try to improve my java skills while working with interactive UI. All code and 'art' was made completely by me using reference to other java Swing projects. I'm proud of how this project turned out and the inner workings were not as complicated as I had previously thought.
