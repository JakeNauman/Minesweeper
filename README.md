# Minesweeper
Interactive Minesweeper game written in Java

7/12/22 Project to try to get a bit more complicated with Java. Working with graphics was a nightmare, but once that was figured out creating the actual game wasn't too difficult. All code and 'art' was made completely by me using reference to other java Swing projects. I could add more features in the future but eh

To test it out simply open the Minesweeper folder in your IDE with Java installed. It was made in VSCode but Eclipse should work.
